# MortalityRiskPrediction
My freelance project is focused on helping a lecturer from Brawijaya University in writing her dissertation on predicting deaths due to COVID-19 based on symptoms using Excel files. The data set contained many missing values, which were addressed through imputation using Random Forest theory. For modeling, a supervised learning algorithm is used. In the process of analysis and modeling using the Python programming language, while for deployment, HTML and CSS are used along with Flask for creating the API.
