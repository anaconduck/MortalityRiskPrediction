# MortalityRiskPrediction
My freelance project is focused on helping a lecturer from Brawijaya University in writing her dissertation on predicting deaths due to COVID-19 based on symptoms using Excel files. The data set contained many missing values, which were addressed through imputation using Random Forest theory. For modeling, a supervised learning algorithm is used. This project uses the Python programming language for data analysis and modeling, while for deployment, it employs HTML and CSS, along with Flask as the API.
